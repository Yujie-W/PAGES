The ever increasing amount of data, various forms of data, and different layouts of data make this problem even more serious. While the intention of sharing data within the community is to promote future research, the increasing fragmentation makes it harder and harder for researchers to find and reuse them, particularly for newbies. Taking my personal experience as an example, to collect the global datasets for the CliMA Land Model, we spent weeks and months to identify which datasets to use, download the data from different sources, standardize the datasets, and learn how to read the datasets correctly with different formats (such as NetCDF, GeoTIFF, CSV, and binary) with different programming languages.
